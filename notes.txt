Docker works with layer of applications
(EG. OS, DB, Node-js etc. are all different layers)

When pulling a docker already present they are not downloaded again.
Layers can be used by multiple containers at once

docker run -d = detach mode

docker ps = list containers
docker images = list images

(execute in interactive terminal = see container terminal)
docker exec -it <id or name> <shell = /bin/bash>

docker run <image> = create container from image (-d = detach, -p = ports binding (-p<host:container>), --name <name>)
docker start = restart a stopped container

Docker compose:
version is the docker compose version
a network is automatically created common to the containers

Dockerfile:
RUN can be used multiple times
CMD is the entry-point, the "main command"
